Q1) what is your understanding of blockchain ?

Ans 1) When i was reading about bitcion minning , i got to know that all the transcations preformed by the specific bitcoin minner are stored in blocks and this all together forms the block
chain. sloving complex math problems and number of transactions they recieve bitcion. It hepls in cryptocuurrency. After learrning from Letsupgrade course, i understand blockchain in more detail , like it is used for security , no tempering of data, validity
, how we can prevent hacking by use of blockchain and immutable.

Q2) What is the core problem Blockchain is trying to solve ?

Ans 2) Core problems Blockchain is trying to solve are Security , Authenticity,Data losses, data security and trust by making legder public.  Main aim of blockchain is to remove the middle men. 

Q3) What are the few features Blockchain will give you ?

Ans 3) Features of blockchain are :
        
       1. Verifiable
       2. Unchangeable
       3. Tamper proof
       4. Immutable
       5. Decentralized
       
       
Q4) What all things Block contains ?

Ans 4) Block cointains :

        1. Block number
        2. Records
        3. Previous block signature
        4. Current Block signature
        5. Mining Key
        
Q5)  How is the verifiability of Blockchain is been attained ?

Ans 5)  Verifiabillity hepls in data security so that there will be no tempering og data.

        Verifiabillity is attained with the help of the uniquie key for the data in each block.
   
   Formula :
   present block signature= data of present block + previous block signature
   
   ex) let signature of first block be 'sig1'
         data of first of first block= sig 1
        
        for second block , signature will be:
        sig1 + data of second block= sig2
        
        and so on.....
